   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patchy exposition of XSLT type pattern syntax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In XSLT ยง5.4.2.2 Type Patterns, the exposition of the grammar is "patchy" - it includes some production rules such as &lt;code&gt;FieldDeclaration&lt;/code&gt; that are in the subtree of the main production rule (&lt;code&gt;TypePattern&lt;/code&gt;) without giving all the intermediate rules that connect this rule to the root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy enough to correct this by hand, but it would be nice to prevent this happening by automating the generation of these families of grammar rules, perhaps by including all rules in the subtree up to a depth of 3, say. It would also be nice to simply list the productions to be included without having to decide manually which of them should be the principal target of &lt;code&gt;termref&lt;/code&gt; references (by being marked with an ID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
