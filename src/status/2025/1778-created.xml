   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1456 Lookup expressions filtered by type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #1456&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows selection of records by type within a JSON tree, for example &lt;code&gt;$json ?? ~record(first, last) ? last&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that the use of the tilde here is controversial but I think this kind of query is going to be very common; it needs something simple and I think people will get used to it. No-one has suggested anything that is obviously better, and I propose to also use &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; in other similar contexts, for example type patterns in XSLT, which will increase familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest reading &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; as "of type".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
