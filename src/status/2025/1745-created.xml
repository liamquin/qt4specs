   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement expanding/collapsing ToC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to merge this one because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CG agreed they wanted this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the changes are presentational, there are no technical changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PR build won't work anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did make a couple of executive decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of "..." as the target to click on didn't seem like a practical affordance. It's not a common use of ellipsis and it looked too much like it simply meant that part of the title was elided. I went with right and down triangles instead. And I added the few lines of JS required to make them "turn".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a top-level expand/collapse that does all of the sections. I wasn't happy that with the new UI, there was no way to get an overview of the document by seeing all of the section titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tinkered with the CSS. I'm not uniformly happy with it, especially with the treatment of long titles, but I think the aesthetic failings are infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to review accessibility before we try to publish as a CG Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
