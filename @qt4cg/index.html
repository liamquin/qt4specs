The entries in such a map would be sorted by key, but there's no attempt to maintain sort order in subsequent put() operations.</p>
<p>We introduce map:sort($m) essentially as a convenient shorthand for <code>map:of-pairs(sort(map:pairs($m), fn{?key}))</code>.</p>
<p>And then we introduce something like <code>map:get-range($from, $to)</code> which returns the keys (or pairs, or entries) whose keys are in a given range -- which the implementation can optimize if it knows the map has been sorted.</p>

Back in 2016 I published a paper at XML Prague (https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2016mhk.pdf) with the rather disappointing result that for a couple of non-trivial JSON transformation tasks, the easiest solution was to convert the JSON to XML, transform the XML, and then convert it back. In many ways it was that discovery that motivated the whole XSLT 4.0 project. So I want to review to what extent we have solved that problem, and what remains to be done. In particular, I have recently raised a number of open issues related to how we transform JSON-derived trees of maps and arrays using template rules, and I'm not sure we can resolve those issues without testing the proposals against real use cases.</p>
<p>I'm proposing to take as a case study the Java-to-C# transpiler which we described in a 2021 paper at https://www.saxonica.com/papers/markupuk-2021mhk.pdf. This is a real XSLT application in daily use. It invokes the (open source) JavaParser to emit an XML representation of Java source code, it performs various transformations of that XML, and then finally spits out equivalent C# source code. My basic question is: suppose the JavaParser had chosen to emit JSON instead of XML (as it might perfectly reasonably have chosen to do). Would we be able to write the transpiler in XSLT 4.0 to work entirely within the JSON space, avoiding all use of XML?</p>
<p>I chose this case study for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's entirely plausible that the input might have been JSON rather than XML</li>
<li>The application relies very heavily (and successfully) on rule-based processing: if we didn't have template rules, then it would be dominated by large xsl:choose statements with hundreds of branches.</li>
<li>At around 5000 lines of XSLT, it's large enough to be non-trivial, yet small enough to be tractable as a case study.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at a couple of other candidates, and found they were things that could be readily done in XSLT 3.0 without any enhancements. For example we have production XSLT 3.0 code that takes a JSON data feed from our online shop at saxonica.com and uses it to update our sales database and to generate license keys. The JSON is voluminous but the structure is simple, and the constructs in XSLT 3.0 for handling maps and arrays are entirely up to the job. The transpiler differs in that the JSON has a much more interesting recursive structure, making rule-based transformation a natural fit to the task.</p>
<p>I'm not proposing to actually produce a complete replacement of the current transpiler, only to explore the task of doing so in enough detail to get some useful insights. I propose to use this issue tracker to capture my working notes as the study proceeds, but if there are recommendations affecting the 4.0 specs (as seems likely), then I will extract those into separate issues. Perhaps at the end of the process I will write up the case study as a conference paper.</p>
<p>My rough plan is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore conversion of the current XML output by JavaParser to JSON using the new elements-to-maps() function. We have a number of open issues on the usability of this function and it will be interesting to see whether we encounter similar difficulties to those that have already been raised, and whether the suggested solutions are appropriate.</li>
<li>Convert the xml-to-java stylesheet to work on this JSON input. This stylesheet is not actually a working part of the transpiler, rather it's something we built as a stepping stone; before attempting to convert the XML syntax tree to C#, we felt it would be instructive to write code that converted it back to Java. This is an 820-line stylesheet and it should be feasible to convert it completely.</li>
<li>The transpiler currently produces, as an intermediate output, a "digest" file containing summary information about all the classes and methods found in the Java code, and their subtyping/override relationships. We then have a process that augments this digest with attributes that are needed by the C# generation, for example which methods to label with "virtual" or "override" modifiers. I propose to experiment with producing (and transforming) this digest in JSON rather than XML format.</li>
<li>Examine the XSLT code that generates C# output to look for features that appear to be tricky to convert, for example anything that uses the parent or ancestor axis, and study to what extent we now have the capability in XSLT 4.0 to handle those situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this format (a GitHub issue) to record progress carries a risk that there will be comments that take things off at a tangent. Please help by resisting that temptation: if there are interesting issues raised in your mind, please take those up as separate issues.</p>

<h3>1. <code>ArrowExpr</code> target must be optional</h3>
<p>The current definition in the specification is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ArrowExpr ::= UnaryExpr (SequenceArrowTarget | MappingArrowTarget | LookupArrowTarget)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the target part must at least be optional, or better zero-or-more:</p>
<pre><code>ArrowExpr ::= UnaryExpr (SequenceArrowTarget | MappingArrowTarget | LookupArrowTarget)*
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise arrow targets are expected almost everywhere. Making it zero-or-more allows parsing of</p>
<pre><code>a =&gt; b() =&gt; c()
</code></pre>
<p>which would not be possible without extra parentheses if it was optional.</p>
<h3>2. Missing <code>preceding-sibling</code> in <code>ReverseAxis</code></h3>
<p>The <code>ReverseAxis</code> production currently appears as:</p>
<pre><code>ReverseAxis ::= ( "ancestor"
                | "ancestor-or-self"
                | "parent"
                | "preceding"
                | "preceding-or-self"
                | "preceding-sibling-or-self" ) "::"

<p>It is missing the <code>prededing-sibling</code> axis.</p>

<p>I propose that if the contained sequence constructor is non-empty then instead of ignoring it, we should use it to create the content of the new map or array. Specifically, for maps xsl:copy will behave essentially like xsl:map, and for arrays it will behave essentially like xsl:array.</p>
<p>This is an incompatibility with 3.1, but since a contained sequence constructor is currently totally useless in this situation, it doesn't seem likely to cause any trouble.</p>
<p>I also propose that rather than using the new built-in <code>on-no-match="shallow-copy-all</code>, we should extend the semantics of <code>shallow-copy</code> to cover maps and arrays (as currently defined for <code>shallow-copy-all</code>). Again, there is an incompatibility, but the current rules are so unhelpful that it's unlikely people are relying on them.</p>
<p>I also propose that when apply-templates is applied to a map or array, it should be automatically pinned if it is not pinned already. The means that match patterns can be used with a lot more context to match the deep contents of the map or array and override the processing of the built-in templates.</p>
<p>And I propose that when apply-templates is applied to a map or array and there is no <code>select</code> attribute, it should "do the right thing" by applying templates to the map or array contents, rather than using the useless default of <code>child::node()</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the pattern <code>P1 ?? P2</code>, where <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> are patterns, should match any labelled item $L provided that $L matches P2, and <code>$L?...</code> (that is, <code>($L =&gt; label())?ancestors()</code> ) matches <code>P1</code>.</p>
<p>Note that neither the syntax nor the semantics are directly related to the lookup operator in XPath. In particular, P2 is a pattern, not a KeySpecifier. But there is a strong analogy, both with the use of <code>?</code> and <code>??</code> in XPath expressions, and with the use of <code>/</code> and <code>//</code> in patterns.</p>

<p>I propose introducing the key specifier <code>..</code>, with <code>$M?..</code> being a shorthand for <code>($M =&gt; label())?parent</code>, giving a convenient and familiar way to navigate from a j-node to its parent in a pinned tree. For example, <code>$M?..?name</code> gives the value of the <code>name</code> property in the immediately containing map.</p>
<p>Similarly, I propose introducing the key specifier <code>...</code> to navigate to ancestors, so <code>$M?...</code> becomes a shorthand for <code>($M =&gt; label())?ancestors()</code>, and <code>$M?...?name</code> returns the <code>name</code> property of all containing maps.</p>
<p>For symmetry I suggest we also provide <code>...</code> as an abbreviated axis step, short for <code>ancestor::node()</code>.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a better name for "pinned". Perhaps "tracked" better captures that what it does is to track downward navigation steps and make them reversible.</p>
<p>I'd also like to introduce the terms <code>j-tree</code> and <code>j-node</code>. A j-tree is a map or array, recursively expanded to include its entries or members. A j-node is a value in a j-tree. Perhaps confine the usage to maps and arrays that have been pinned/tracked.</p>

This became more complicated with the introduction of <code>xsl:next-match</code> in XSLT 2.0 - what should happen if the item matches both branches? It became more complicated again in XSLT 3.0 with the introduction of <code>on-multiple-match</code> - is it a multiple match if an item matches both branches? And in 4.0 it's complicated further by the introduction of constructs like <code>match="element(A|B)"</code> which is deemed equivalent to <code>match=A|B</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to break this cycle with a backwards-incompatible change. The default priority of a union pattern should be the numeric maximum of the default priorities of its branches; the treatment as being somewhat-equivalent to two separate template rules should go. We should encourage implementations to issue a compatibility warning if a union pattern appears with no explicit priority, and with multiple branches having different default priority.</p>

<p>There’s no definition of DM4.</p>
<p>(Review of the link targets and comments on what (if anything) the remaining boxes and labels should link to most appreciated.)</p>

<p>Drops array bound checking from <code>array:get</code>, arrays-as-functions, and array lookup. Returns () instead of an error FOAY0001 when the index is out of bounds. This brings arrays and maps into closer alignment.</p>
<p>Drops the <code>$fallback</code> argument of <code>array:get()</code></p>
<p>Adds a new function <code>array:get-if-present()</code> which replicates the old behaviour of <code>array:get()</code>.</p>
<p>Functions such as <code>array:put</code>, <code>array:replace</code>, <code>array:insert-before</code>, <code>array:head</code>, <code>array:tail</code> continue to perform bound checking.</p>
