Special syntax, the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#lookup-arrow-expression"><strong><code>=?&gt;</code> operator</strong></a>, was introduced to call such a function. As a whole this is a huge step forward providing the user with a new, powerful mechanism to conveniently express relationships and calculations over several member-values of a map instance.</p>
<p>I am raising this issue with the goal of further improving and simplifying for the user the way to define and call a member function of a map/record, giving it a convenient way to access the values of other members of the instance of the map, on which the call has been issued.</p>
<p>In my work, I have been trying to define a number of functions that must belong to a map/record and that should be able to access other members of the same map/record to which these functions belong.</p>
<p>The experience was far from satisfying and here I describe the main problems I encountered when trying to use the <strong><code>=?&gt;</code></strong> operator, and some obvious suggestions how we can further simplify the syntax for calling any member function of a map or record.</p>
<h1>1. Problems trying to use the <strong><code>=?&gt;</code></strong> operator</h1>
<p>Here are the main problems I ran into.</p>
<p><strong>Problem1</strong>. The <strong><code>=?&gt;</code></strong> operator was:</p>
<ul>
<li>weird-looking;</li>
<li>difficult to use;</li>
<li>difficult to understand;</li>
<li>difficult to read;</li>
<li>feeling unnatural.
It would be much better if we didn't have to use any special operator at all in order to call a member function "<strong><em><code>myFunction</code></em></strong>" of a map <strong><em><code>$m</code></em></strong> by simply:
<strong><em><code>$m?myFunction(&lt;tuple of any arguments defined in the signature of the function&gt;)</code></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem2</strong>. There is no example, in the sections that describe the record type (<strong><em><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#lookup-arrow-expression">3.2.8.3</a></em></strong>), showing a record member-function that accesses the values of other members of the same instance of the record.
<strong>Thus, the new feature is effectively hidden</strong> for people who want to work with records.
We need such an example for a record, so that we don't forget that any record is also a map and possesses all functionality a map has to offer. And a statement to this effect must be added to the description of records.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 3</strong>.  This syntax is overcomplicated and difficult to use and remember, resulting in unnecessarily long and complex expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $rectangle := {
  "width": 20,
  "height": 12,
  "area": fn($this) { $this?width * $this?height }
} 
return $rectangle =?&gt; area()
</code></pre>
<p>It would be significantly better to use a much simplified syntax such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $rectangle := {
  "width": 20,
  "height": 12,
  "area": fn() { ?width * ?height }
} 
return $rectangle ? area()
</code></pre>
<p>Recognizing that <strong><em><code>?name</code></em></strong> is already used since XPath 3.1 as <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-xpath-31-20170321/#id-unary-lookup">Unary Lookup Operator</a></strong>, and to avoid the unlikely case of collision, when a member function accesses other members of the map-owner-instance that happen to have identically the same names as expected constituents of the current context item (upon which the function is applied), we can introduce a special character to denote the current map-owner-instance, thus the above example could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $rectangle := {
  "width": 20,
  "height": 12,
  "area": fn() { ^width * ^height }
} 
return $rectangle ? area()
</code></pre>
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<p><strong>Solution for Problem 1</strong> above (weirdness of the <strong><em><code>=?&gt;</code></em></strong> operator:<br>
<em>Do not introduce any special operator</em>. Just use <code>?</code> to invoke the member-function.</p>
<p><strong>Solution for Problem 2</strong> above (lack of example of a record having a member-function that accesses other members of the same map-owner-instance).
Obviously, <em>provide such an example</em>. Also <em>reiterate there that all features and functionality of a map continue to be available for records</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution for Problem 3</strong> above (overcomplicated syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of the <strong><em><code>=?&gt;</code></em></strong> operator. Use <strong><code>?</code></strong> for all references to member-functions.</li>
<li>Don't use any special variable like <strong><em><code>$this</code></em></strong>. For example, the current example in the documentation:
<code>"area": fn($this) { $this?width * $this?height }</code>
should instead be:
<code>"area": fn() { ^width * ^height }</code></li>
<li>use the <strong><code>^</code></strong> character to denote <em>owner-map-instance</em> membership. Thus <strong><em><code>^width</code></em></strong> means: "<em>The member named <strong>"width"</strong> of the map instance upon which the current function was invoked</em>"</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I will issue a PR with the solutions, provided there are not any substantial comments hilighting problems with this proposal.</p>

<p>The HTML5 standard, for its part, has actually always allowed the parser to be aborted upon encountering a parse error (though no browser does this), so the function definition would seem to require that <code>parse-html("&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;", { "method": "html", "html-version": 5 })</code> invariably raises an error, given that the input is invalid (missing opening <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, etc.).</p>
<p>I don't think this is the intended behavior; my suggestion is to either have it be explicitly implementation-defined as to which parse errors cause err:FODC0011 to be raised, or require that it is never raised for HTML5.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This function can be useful  in any scenario, where the evaluation of a function call requires repeated evaluation of this same, or other functions. Often in such cases, the algorithm needs access to a general structure, containing the cached results of executing possibly many different functions applied on specific arguments-tuples.
What <strong>unique key</strong> is needed under which to group all invocations of a specific function and then the mapping between their function-call arguments and the result of the call? Remarkably, the identity of a function fits exactly the requirements (uniqueness / one per function) for such a key.
As we already have a function-identity property in the Data Model for each function-item, it is straightforward to provide this identity, and the <strong><code>fn:function-identity</code></strong> does exactly that.</li>
<li>The function identity, by definition, is generated upon the creation of a function and has meaning throughout of the life of that function. It is not meaningful to store this value across different executions, because the identity given to a function in <em>execution1</em> will generally be different from the identity, given to it in <em>execution2</em>. However, the definitions of system functions (functions defined in the specifications under the system namespaces - with standard prefixes: <strong><em><code>xs</code>, <code>fn</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>array</code>, <code>math</code>, <code>err</code>, <code>output</code></em></strong>) can be assigned permanent identities in the official Specs documents, requiring every implementation to use exactly this published identity value for the official, system functions, thus achieving efficiency and convenience during debugging.</li>
<li>The function identity, being a string, can be used as a key in a map, thus making it possible to map a particular function to a sequence of items. It becomes possible to allow function items as map-keys by extending the definition of <strong><em><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#dt-same-key">same-keys</a></em></strong> with: "If both keys are function items: <code>$f1</code> and <code>$f2</code>, then they are <strong>the same</strong> if and only if:
<strong><em><code>function-identity($f1) eq function-identity($f2)</code></em></strong></li>
</ol>

This function analyses the data and produces a conversion plan, which can be supplied to the "layouts" option (perhaps renamed) of the main function.</p>
<p>The benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plan can be tweaked after it is created by manual adjustment, for example if the user wants to use "empty-plus" layout wherever the system's choice would be "empty", or to take account of anticipated future changes in the structure.</li>
<li>The plan can be used to process documents that did not exist at the time it was created, thus ensuring that future documents are all converted in the same way, and avoiding the overhead of rebuilding the plan each time.</li>
<li>The plan can be created from a small sample of the documents to be converted.</li>
<li>The plan can be created from a large collection of documents including documents that don't need to be converted but which may contain structural elements that are not revealed by the documents that need converting now.</li>
<li>The user can examine the plan to see what it is doing, which is useful for diagnostics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should define the format of the plan (a map from element names to layouts) so that it can conveniently be serialized as a JSON document.</p>

I can imagine, for example, an implementation of an Invisible XML processor that has the ability to return a map or even a CSV structure instead of XML. (XML is the required, standard result in 1.0 but implementors have been known to offer user options to produce other serializations and one area of potential change in the future is other serialization formats.)</p>

<pre><code>[
   {"name": "John", "address": { .... }, job-history: [ { .... }, {....} ]},
   {"name": "Jane", "address": { .... }, job-history: [ { .... }, {....} ]}
]

and to process it using template rules of the form:

&lt;xsl:template match="record(name, address, job-history)"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="?*"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="(pattern matching key 'name')"&gt;...&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="(pattern matching key 'address')"&gt;...&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="(pattern matching key 'job-history')"&gt;...&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We have nearly all the ingredients in place for this. In particular, we can ensure that the <code>select="?*"</code> selects values that are labelled with the relevant key, making it technically possible to match values according to that key: <code>select="?*"</code> might select an xs:string value "John", but the string is labelled with the property key="name", so it can in principle match a template rule designed to process the "name" value.</p>
<p>The only piece that's missing is how to write the match patterns. We can write <code>match=".[label()?key = 'name']"</code>, but that's hopelessly long-winded.</p>
<p>I propose that we use the syntax <code>match="?name"</code> to match a value that is labelled with the key "name". This feels intuitive and natural, and 99% of users won't trouble with the complex underlying semantics.</p>
<p>We can extend this by borrowing other parts of the Lookup expression syntax, for example <code>match="?('X', 'Y', 'Z')"</code> to match several keys.</p>
<p>I would also suggest promoting the operators "union", "intersect" and "except" so they can be used to combine any patterns (not just node patterns) so this could be written <code>match="?X | ?X | ?Z"</code>, or we could write <code>match="?* except ?X"</code>. But note that this would create an expectation that users can also write <code>select="?* except ?X"</code> in an XPath expression; and that's quite hard to achieve: see also #1794.</p>
