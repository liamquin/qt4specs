** Issue triage

:END:

The plan this week was to focus on open XSLT issues that had not been triaged.
Since there are no such issues this week, I’ve put the ‘optional’ ones back on
the list. There was a request to review several these again.

For this week, please focus your attention on these issues:

+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/322][#322]]: Map construction in XSLT: xsl:record instruction
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/323][#323]]: add select attribute to xsl:text
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/366][#366]]: Support xsl:use-package with xsl:package-location
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/451][#451]]: Multiple Schemas
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/714][#714]]: Function annotations in XSLT
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1111][#1111]]: xsl:pipeline
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1153][#1153]]: XSLT: debugging template rule selection
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1251][#1251]]: Allow sequence constructor in extension instructions that are implemented with named templates
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1537][#1537]]: XSLT: local functions within an enclosing xsl:mode
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1698][#1698]]: Allow select attribute for xsl:call-template instruction
+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1724][#1724]]: Allow @copy-namespaces on <xsl:mode>?

If we get through all of these, I propose that we return to the list above and
start from the top.
