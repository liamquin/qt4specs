   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reorganise top-level sections in XDM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improved presentation of the TOC for our specs makes it rather obvious that the structure of the XDM spec has become unbalanced. Most of the spec is about node trees; information about atomic values, maps, functions etc is hard to find, and sometimes appears in strange places such as "Terminology".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the way the spec is assembled from multiple entities serves little purpose. It makes it harder for editors to find the text that needs to be edited and to locate markup errors introduced in the course of editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
