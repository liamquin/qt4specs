   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordered Maps: maps that retain insertion order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, XDM maps are “unordered”: An implementation is allowed to organize entries in a way that optimizes lookup, not order. The entries do not have a predictable order unless they are explicitly sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases in which it is helpful if the “insertion order” is preserved – i.e., the order in which new map entries are added to a map. While the insertion order is not relevant if a map is exclusively used for lookups, it may be beneficial if the input includes deliberately sorted key/value pairs, such as (often) in JSON data, configurations or key/value sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created this issue because there was some confusion in #564, and on Slack, about this map flavor and “sorted maps”, which are discussed in issue #564: Sorted maps hold all map entries sorted by the key, using a comparator or (in its basic variant) &lt;code&gt;fn:data#1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR #1609 attempts to solve both requirements at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
