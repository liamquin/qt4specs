Using the ~PRG-*~ tags seems like it would be inviting confusion. New tags
proposal:

+ ~Reviewed-required~, this is a required feature; we can’t progress without it.
+ ~Reviewed-optional~, this is an optional feature we’re still hoping to finish.
+ ~Reviewed-close~, this is an optional feature that we’d like to have, but
  we’re going to abandon it if no one provides a detailed change proposal.
  (This category implies “close without further action” at the next meeting.)
+ ~Reviewed-easy~, ~Reviewed-hard~, optional tags indicating the consensus
  intuition about how difficult it would be to address the issue.

There are 70 untriaged issues. We can start at the top, or the bottom, or with
nominations for “easy to categorize” issues.
