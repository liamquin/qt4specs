   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maps constructed using streamed xsl:fork instruction should not be ordered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the techniques used in XSLT streaming is to build multiple outputs during a single streamed pass of the input, and the multiple outputs can be captured in different entries in a map (in different prongs of an &lt;code&gt;xsl:fork&lt;/code&gt; instruction). The ordering of such a map should be implementation-dependent, in order to allow construction in parallel threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I think that an xsl:map instruction used in this way should probably not allow duplicate keys. In principle we could collect key/value pairs during the streamed processing and then resolve duplicates at the end, but it's extra complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
