   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1713 Revise code for generating production rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main change here is to change the way "scraps" are expanded: these are the local collections of production rules that appear inline within the spec. These are now driven by a single &lt;code&gt;prodrecap&lt;/code&gt; element naming the rule to be expanded, and the logic is now automated for deciding (a) which subsidiary production rules to include in the scrap, and (b) which occurrence of a production rule to use as the target for a hyperlinked reference to that rule, depending on where the reference appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with this there has been a fair bit of deletion of legacy code and general modernisation (e.g using XSLT 2.0 and 3.0 constructs where appropriate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
