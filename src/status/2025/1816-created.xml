   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programmatic partial application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a programmatic way of doing partial function application, in particular it's very difficult to to a partial application supplying the first argument of a function item without knowing statically how many other arguments there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest extending fn:apply so that the second argument can be a map with integer keys; it can supply some or all of the arguments to a function, and arguments that aren't supplied are retained in the returned partially-applied function item. For the example cited where only the first argument is to be supplied, supplying an array of length one would be equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
