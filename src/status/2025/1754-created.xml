   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inverse functions to bin:hex, bin:bin, and bin:octal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing formal equivalents for the functions in the binary EXPath module, I found that while we have bin:bin() which turns a string of 0s and 1s into a binary value, we don't have any convenient way of doing the inverse. The same is true for octal. For hex we can cast to hexBinary and then cast to string, but that's a bit of a circumlocution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose functions bin:to-bin, bin:to-octal and bin:to-hex that convert a binary value to a string of binary, octal, or hexadecimal digits respectively. Perhaps with an options parameter that allows a grouping separator and grouping size to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
