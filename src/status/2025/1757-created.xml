   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build cleanup: remove the "by hand" diffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless I'm mistaken, the 'by hand' diffs, the ones that are created from explicit diff markup added by the editors, have not been consistently maintained for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have places that point to them, and I think this could be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that we pull all of that machinery out and remove references to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
