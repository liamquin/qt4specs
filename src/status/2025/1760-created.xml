   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove hand-generated diffs from the builds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #1757&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR build isn't going to be very informative, but I'll leave this one open in case anyone wants to review the source code diffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not attempt to remove the XML markup from the specs. Perhaps we should, but I think we'd want to manage that carefully to avoid an absolute mountain of merge conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
