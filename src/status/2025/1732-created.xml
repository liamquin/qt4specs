   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1720 grammar simplification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR primarily affects the grammar file, simplifying it to remove most of the material that is only there to support the generation of a JavaCC parser (which has probably not been achievable since XPath/XQuery 2.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section of the grammar that defines the binary operators starting with &lt;code&gt;OrExpr&lt;/code&gt; is now expressed using conventional production rules, rather than the precedence-based grammar previously used. This allows deletion of some convoluted code in grammar2spec.xsl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DTD for the grammar file is revised to exclude many constructs that are no longer used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many simple token definitions (especially those that consist of a simple constant string) have been inlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix #1720&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
