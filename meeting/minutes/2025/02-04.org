:END:
See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1753][#1753]].

+ JWL: Jirka and I have both gone through it. It seems fine; there are good
  formal definitions now. We’ve also done a first pass at getting errors
  corrected. There are still a copy of tiny little things. (Wrong error code,
  for example.)
  + … Encourage you to look through; there are some nice 4.0 syntax “tricks”
    that make the definitions easy to use and understand.
  + … There are no additions; there have been a few things trimmed, but there’s
    very little backwards incompatibility.

Some discussion about when we agreed to take this on.

+ RD: Some of the functions have an additional fn: prefix. 
+ JWL: Those are probably construction operations, piggybacking off stuff in the
  F&O stylesheets.

ACTION: QT4CG-108-01: JWL look at the extra fn: prefixes introduced by the stylesheets in the binary spec

Proposal: Accept this PR.

Accepted.

** PR #1746: Replace processing model diagrams
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-72B1E55F-9FBA-4B83-9EE2-6F017FDBA33F
:END:
See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1746][#1746]].

NW shows the diagrams

+ JWL: Is this SVG? Do we have the sources?
+ NW: Yes, they’re made with GraphViz and checked in the sources.
+ JK: Is there any checking for alignment when things change?
+ NW: No, alas.
+ RD: Can we have links now and tool tips for SQ1 etc.?
+ NW: Yes. Good idea.

TION: QT4CG-108-02: NW to add links and tooltips to the new processing model diagrams

Proposal: Accept this PR.

Accepted.

** Some discussion of the table of contents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-71A05ACA-D99E-4A59-8D95-19E1D985CAE8
:END:

+ DN: Thank you for the expandable/collapsable table of contents.

Some discussion of whether there might be outstanding performance issues in the
JavaScript, especially with respect to the widget that opens/closes the ToC.

If you have an issue, please open an issue.

** Issue triage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-triage
:END:

Using the ~PRG-*~ tags seems like it would be inviting confusion. New tags
proposal:

+ ~Reviewed-required~, this is a required feature; we can’t progress without it.
+ ~Reviewed-optional~, this is an optional feature we’re still hoping to finish.
+ ~Reviewed-close~, this is an optional feature that we’d like to have, but
  we’re going to abandon it if no one provides a detailed change proposal.
  (This category implies “close without further action” at the next meeting.)
+ ~Reviewed-easy~, ~Reviewed-hard~, optional tags indicating the consensus
  intuition about how difficult it would be to address the issue.

There are 70 untriaged issues. We can start at the top, or the bottom, or with
nominations for “easy to categorize” issues.

*** Issue 75
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-75
:END:

Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/75][#75]]: Support processing HTML 5 template element content

+ RD: I think it’s useful to have open. From the discusions that we had, I think
  we can defer it.
+ DB: Do we also have a “meritorious but we need someone to do it”
+ NW: Yes, I can do that.
+ DN: Alternatively, we could make a time when people can present their issues.
+ NW: No. They were on the agenda. 

Reviewed-optional

+ RD: It would be nice to have feedback from people using parse-html if the
  current mechanisms are sufficient.

*** Issue 158
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-158
:END:

Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/158][#158]]: Support optional parameters on dynamic functions

+ RD: I’m happy for this to be optional or closed.
+ DN: I think we should know what prevented the original author from preparing a PR.
+ RD: I created this ticket as a result of discussions in one of the meetings;
  based on a comment from DN, I believe.

Reviewed-optional

*** Issue 285
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-F0D6FC5C-16A2-4E94-AB20-16AB7345BB9F
:END:

Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/285][#285]]: Stability of collections

+ CG: This is about how much latitude implementations have for returning
  collections in a particular order.
+ JLO: I think that it would make sense to make collections nondeterministic.

Reviewed-optional

*** Issue 322
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-322
:END:

Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/322][#322]]: Map construction in XSLT: xsl:record instruction

+ JWL: Can we look at this next week?
+ JK: If a member of the group wishes to avoid assigning a label, then it should
  come with action.

*** Issue 576
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: issue-576
:END:

Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/576][#576]]: JSON serialization: INF/NaN, function items

Reviewed-optional

+ Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/583][#583]]: (array|map):replace → *:substitute or *:change

+ CG: This is just a question of whether we want a map:replace function?
+ JLO: We have specified array and map replace.
+ CG: Yes, but the idea from MK was that we could replace them with
  map:substitute. But it’s been two years.
+ DN: Almost no one knows what this is. It would be better to wait until next week.
+ CG: I suggest we attempt to close this one.

Reviewed-optional

Chair declares the triage exercise a fail for this week. Will put a shorter set
of issues on the list next time with the expectation that members will come
prepared to triage them.

+ JWL: Take all the XSLT once and push them next week.
