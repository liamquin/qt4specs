   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add dedication to MSM (action QT4CG-088-01)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've had this action on my plate for a while. Having written a dedication, there's a follow-up question of where to put it. Having it in only one specification isn't wrong, but it seems slightly odd given that MSM contributed to them all. In the end, I decided to put a full dedication in the XPath specification and link to it from the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rationale for the XPath spec is that it's probaly one that everyone reads. Another possibility was the Data Model as it's "foundational" but I think it's less read than XPath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The published PR won't be write because there are tooling changes required. I've attached a couple of screen shots, one of the full dedication in XPath:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another of the link from the other specs (from XSLT, I think, but they're all the same).&lt;/p&gt;
